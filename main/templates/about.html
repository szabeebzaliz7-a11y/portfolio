                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Python developer with hands-on experience in designing and developing web applications using the
                    Django framework. I have worked extensively with Django’s MVT architecture and ORM to build structured,
                    database-driven applications with a strong emphasis on code quality and performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have contributed to real-world projects such as a business networking platform and a responsive
                    e-commerce website, where I implemented authentication systems, backend logic, and optimized data handling.
                    I enjoy problem-solving, debugging complex issues, and continuously improving application stability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside my professional development work, I am actively upskilling in Data Science and Generative AI
                    through the Entry Elevated program. My long-term goal is to combine strong backend engineering with
                    data-driven and AI-powered solutions.
